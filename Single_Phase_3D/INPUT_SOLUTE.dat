Dispersion statistics: for SP_HS 1=X, 2=Y, 3=Z,  for ST codes, 1=Genreal, 2=every peak as well

To use the checkpoint data to restart the simulation,
You might need to specify the path of the checkpoint data
The path sould be put after the name and the path of the data file.
such as: mpirun -np 3 INPUT.dat /work/jy810/test/
If not given, the default value is ./
