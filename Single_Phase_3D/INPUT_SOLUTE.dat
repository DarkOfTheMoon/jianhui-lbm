INSTRUCTIONS OF PARAMETER INPUT
0				:Constant Concentration BC or 0 flux BC (1=YES, 0=NO)
0 0 0 0 0 0			:Zero Flux BC in xp xn yp yn zp zn (0=No, 1=Yes)
Dispersion statistics: for SP_HS 1=X, 2=Y, 3=Z,  for ST codes, 1=Genreal, 2=every peak as well

To use the checkpoint data to restart the simulation,
You might need to specify the path of the checkpoint data
The path sould be put after the name and the path of the data file.
such as: mpirun -np 3 INPUT.dat /work/jy810/test/
If not given, the default value is ./

===================================================
if ST_6V_peaks is used and checkpoint data is to be used for initialization,
eg. 200                               :INITIALIZATION WITH BACKUP DATA (0=OFF, 1=ON)
when run the simulation, additional prefix is needed:
mpirun -np 3 INPUT_SOLUTE.dat /work/jy810/test/velocity_ /work/jy810/test/checkpoint_
the checkpoint_LBM_checkpoint_psi_200.2.bin_input...... will be loaded
