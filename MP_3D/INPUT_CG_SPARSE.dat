INSTRUCTIONS OF PARAMETER INPUT
0.0556</frac{niu*dt}{dx^2}<0.25

If buffet is add near the geometry boundaries, initial satuation parameter is on and 
partly permeability calculation is used, the default component in the buffet is set as 
component A (1)

0 0				:Psi constant BC in X 0=OFF, 1=Ini psi, 2=Neibourghing,3=Rand
if option3 is used, a saturation of preset saturation will be applied for the boundary


To use the checkpoint data to restart the simulation,
You might need to specify the path of the checkpoint data
The path sould be put after the name and the path of the data file.
such as: mpirun -np 3 INPUT.dat /work/jy810/test/
If not given, the default value is ./
