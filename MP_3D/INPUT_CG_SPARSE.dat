INSTRUCTIONS OF PARAMETER INPUT
0.0556</frac{niu*dt}{dx^2}<0.25

If buffet is add near the geometry boundaries, initial satuation parameter is on and 
partly permeability calculation is used, the default component in the buffet is set as 
component A (1)

0 0				:Psi constant BC in X 0=OFF, 1=Ini psi, 2=Neibourghing,3=Rand
if option3 is used, a saturation of preset saturation will be applied for the boundary


To use the checkpoint data to restart the simulation,
You might need to specify the path of the checkpoint data
The path sould be put after the name and the path of the data file.
such as: mpirun -np 3 INPUT.dat /work/jy810/test/
If not given, the default value is ./


If backup f,rho,psi,rhob,rhor is used, PRESET VALUE FOR BUFFET AREA option
can be used solely without the activation of PRESET SATUATION. 
But the simulation is initialized normally, The PRESET VALUE FOR BUFFET AREA is actived
only if PRESET SATUATION option is ON.


If PRESET VALUE FOR BUFFET AREA option is on, and partially permeability calculation option is also on,
The Initial value of boundary of the buffet will be changed to the preset value for buffet area. So when the 
color boundary is applied, the option 1: use initial value, will take the preset value for the boundary which located in 
buffet area

Relative Perm file format:
Averaged Relative Perm, saturation, local Relative Perm, saturation, least squre rel_perm of the other component2
for Relative Perm file component1
Averaged Relative Perm, saturation, local Relative Perm, saturation, Pressure of left and right hand side, and bodyforce, least square rel_perm is also included at the end of every line.

bodyforce file format:
saturation of component1, saturatino of component2, relative error of saturation as a function of time

Relative permeability measument with Imbibition and Drainage process control function:
NOTE: Component1 is assumed as wetting phase: contact angle should be positive
Should identify the injection direction by give approperiate value for 
0 3				:Psi constant BC in X 0=OFF, 1=Ini psi, 2=Neibourghing,3=Rand:value=line38
0 0				:Psi constant BC in Y
0 0				:Psi constant BC in Z
Least Square fitting should be swiched on and fitting points should be set properly
1 2000                            :0=OFF,1=ON; number of Fitting points;
After injection wetting/non-wetting phase and S_w reach equilibrium, the program will wait 2000*Frequency of results writing
(interval in time steps), then check if the relative permeability has converged/slop is flat. 
This module can also be used to generate initial distributions for binary fluid simulation,
to use this function, set 
1                            :0=OFF,1=ON EXPORT BINARY FLUID DISTRIBUTION psi (CAN BE USED FOR OTHER SIMULATIONS INPUTS)
NOTE: if you don't need the export function, keep it 0, otherwise the relative permeability function will not work properly.


then, set 
1 5 1e-1 20                :0=OFF,1=Imb,2=Drai;No.of data points; (equil cond for least square rel_perm, time steps)
1 1e-5                            :Apply diff force for injec 0=OFF,1=ON,value for injection (to overcome the min cap pres)
the equilibrium condition for rel_perm should be big enough (eg. 1e-1) to save time (the once targeted saturation has been reached, export it, then start increasing or dcreasing again)
and set least square check length short:
1 30                            :0=OFF,1=ON; number of Fitting points;  
Once the targeted saturation has been reached, the program will wait 30*output frequency time steps, then export the distribution.
